# Cucumber REST API CRUD Tests

This repository contains a collection of Cucumber tests for a simple REST API CRUD application. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the REST API by covering the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate automated testing using Cucumber for a RESTful API. The tests are written in Gherkin syntax, which provides a human-readable format for describing the desired behavior of the API. By utilizing Cucumber, the tests can be easily understood and maintained by both technical and non-technical team members.

## Features

- End-to-end tests for the REST API CRUD operations.
- Test scenarios covering various scenarios and edge cases.
- Integration with popular Java testing frameworks, such as JUnit and Spring Boot Test.
- Integration with TestRestTemplate for making HTTP requests and asserting responses.
